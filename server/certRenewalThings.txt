i made a few new lines in /etc/letsencrypt/rewnal/ironman.gg.conf
basically just says to do webroot renewal, and gave it the webroot below that
i had also commented out the redirecting code in client side stuff, idk if that has an effect or not

to renew give er the ol "certbot renew" and it should be gucci flip flops
